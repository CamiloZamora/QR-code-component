## My process

I have a bit of experince with HTML/CSS, I've been practice on my own.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I´ve practice some concepts I was working some time ago, HTML structure is pretty straight forward. But, CSS is a little more complex due to the amount of effects, properties, styles, etc you can achive.

### Continued development

Definitely, I must work and practice a lot of CSS in order to get able to creat more complex web pages. I would like to start using some frameworks but, think it´s not time and missing more knowledge to use them properly.

### Useful resources

- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) - I think this is a powerful "tool" with lots of usful information.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp) - This web site has tons of info, and really guide you throughout all concepts related not just to HTML and CSS but JS, JAVA, SQL... and many more.
